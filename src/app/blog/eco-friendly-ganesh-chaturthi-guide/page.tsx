                        <p>Ganesh Chaturthi is a festival of immense joy and devotion. As we welcome the beloved Lord Ganesha into our homes, it's also a perfect opportunity to honor Mother Nature, who he represents. Traditionally, idols were made from river clay and returned to the earth, a beautiful symbol of life's cycle. Today, with the rise of Plaster of Paris (PoP) idols, our water bodies face pollution. But a wonderful movement is bringing us back to our roots. Let's explore how to celebrate a vibrant, joyous, and eco-friendly Ganesh Chaturthi.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="idols">Choosing the Heart of the Festival: The Eco-Friendly Murti</h3>
                        <p>The single most impactful choice you can make is selecting a water-soluble idol. These idols are designed to dissolve gracefully, returning to the elements without harming aquatic life.</p>
                        
                        <div className="my-8">
                            {ecoFriendlyGanesha && <ProductCard product={ecoFriendlyGanesha} />}
                        </div>

                        <h4>DIY Ganesha: The Ultimate Personal Touch</h4>
                        <p>For a truly personal and family-bonding experience, consider making your own Ganesha idol. It's a wonderful activity to do with children, teaching them the importance of the festival and sustainability from a young age.</p>

                        <h3>Sustainable Decorations and Practices</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use Natural Flowers & Leaves:</strong> Decorate your mandap with fresh flowers, mango leaves, and banana leaves instead of plastic and thermocol.</li>
                            <li><strong>Symbolic Immersion:</strong> Immerse your clay idol at home in a bucket or drum. You can then pour the water into your garden, a beautiful way to complete the cycle of life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Serve Prasad on Leaf Plates:</strong> Reduce waste by using traditional 'pattals' (leaf plates) or reusable steel utensils for serving prasad.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>An eco-friendly celebration is the greatest offering we can makeâ€”one that honors both our beloved deity and the planet he represents.</p>
                        </blockquote>
